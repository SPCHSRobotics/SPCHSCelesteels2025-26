This will run the robot through multiple defined positions with each step being defined as a leg.
Each leg will do one movement or one action with either (x, y, heading/imu) coordinates for movement, or an
action performed with servos/other motors

Coordinates and positions should be defined in their own file named along the lines of autoCoordinates.
This way you can edit the coordinates and angles in one file without messing with the logic and processes
needed to execute the auto. This will help prevent many debugging issues.

        LEGS/STEPS
Init
    Starting position is defined as (x0,y0, h0)

Leg 1
    Move forward without turning
    Move to (x1,y1,h1)
        y1 = y0, h1 = h0 but notated separately for ease of changing and having clear coordinates
        each position, with x1 being the only one to change. This principle should be applied consistently
        to have easy readability.
        x1 = x0 + translation

Leg 2
    Turn right 90 degrees
    Move to (x2, y2, h2)
        x2 = x1, y2 = y1: these are unchanged
        h2 = h1 + 90

Additional Legs
    Set target coordinates for where you want the desired position to be, doing one step at a time.
