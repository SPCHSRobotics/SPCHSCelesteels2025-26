            Math (motor instructions)

Conversion
    Unit
        Multiply motor movements by internal gearbox, and wheel diameter to get a conversion to inches

    Position
        Robot will need to track it's current position and on each leg compare it to target position.
        This will calculate relative position finding the breaking down the movements from absolute
        (x,y,h) to relative (x,y,h), this way the bot can actually use it.
            h stands for heading

        for movement from (x0,y0,h0) -> (x1,y1,h1), relative would be (x1-x0,y1-y0,h1-h0)

Individual Movements
        These are fairly simple and need to fundamentally work, so we have to come back to this and have
        it always work
        All movements are done relative not absolute

    Forward (x+)
        All motors: forward 1 inch

    Forward-Right (x+,y+)
        Forward left and back right: forward 2(?) inches
            not sure how much it should be, it might be sqrt(2)
        Forward right and back left: do not move

    Right (y+)
        Forward Left, Back Right: Forward 1 inch
        Back Left, Forward Right: Backward 1 inch

Rotation
    Rotate in place
        Assume 18 inch cube bot
        rotating in place would be a 90 degree rotation
        radius sqrt(162) ~ 12.728
        arc length of quarter, circumference/4
        Circumference = 2pir
        arc = piR/2
        approx. 20 inches

        rotate left 90 degrees
        Left motors: forward 20 inches
        Right motors: back 20 inches
